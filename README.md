## Issues

1. On Charts tab, in tablet view and above, give charts more width, without affecting responiveness
2. Search bar - at the moment, when selectedCompany is similiar title to newSearch, searchbar deletes it quickly....related to debounce
3. Some times when API malfunctions, doesnt update UI. Would be better to get it to just change to UI to blank to reflect this
